The conditional test "maxbytes-sizeof(val) >= 0" always succeeds
because the subtraction is done in unsigned type size_t.
No matter what the values of the arguments are, the result will
always be a non-negative integer. 

To solve this problem, we can simply use the following comparison
test:

if(maxbytes >= sizeof(val))
	memcpy(buf, (void *) &val, sizeof(val));
