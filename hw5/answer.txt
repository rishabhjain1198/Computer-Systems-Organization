And sure enough, target.txt was deleted.

All RIO functions take pointers in the arguments. Thus, it really 
depends on the caller whether it passes the addresses carefully 
or not. If the caller passes the address of some shared data, then 
the functions are implicitly non-reentrant. Otherwise, if the caller 
does not pass address of shared data, then the functions cannot 
access the shared data, and are thus implicitly reentrant. 

All in all, if we assume the caller functions are careful, the RIO 
functions are implicitly reentrant, but not explicitly reentrant.
